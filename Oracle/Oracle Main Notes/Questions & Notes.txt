* Interrelated means one is dependent on another.
* OLTP is used for storing day-to-day transactions i.e storing less amount of data. A real time ex of OLTP is mini-statement of an ATM.
* OLAP is used for storing the historical data(big data) of a particular business. If we want to see the transaction details of 5 years then we fetch the data from OLAP but not in OLTP. 
* Once OLTP database is full then it transfer the previous data to OLAP.
* "Application" is the source of OLTP & "OLTP" is the source of OLAP.
* Inside OLAP a huge amount of data are maintained.
* We cannot directly connect to OLAP(data-warehouse).
* Once OLTP is full then the oldest data is transferred into OLAP, Once OLAP is full then it creates another data-warehouse through the help of ETL tools, after still it is full then it creates another data-warehouse like this....
* Flatfile is also called Textfile.
* No dupulicates=No inconsistency.
* It is very difficult to retrieve data from files.Because If we want to retrieve/read data from files then we have to develope an application using some high-level languages like C/CPP/Java/.Net etc.
* Data integrity means data-validations. It is not supported when data is stored on files.
* Through DBMS we can create database memory.
* DBMS acts as an interface between users and database memory/database.
      ( Users<----------------------> DBMS s/w  <---------------------> Database )
* When OLTP will be full then it transfer the data into OLAP through ETL tools.this transferring is known as job scheduling.Ex at the time of 11.45pm to 12.20am we cannot book a ticket from irctc, so at that time job scheduling happens.
* Problem No 4
   ===========
  Enter user-name:system/Jilucse@2002
  Unreachable host
  Enter user-name:\sys as sysdba
  Enter password:sys
  connected
  SQL>Alter user system account unlock
  SQL>Alter user system identified by Jilucse2002
  Enter user-name:system/Jilucse2002
  connected  
* Problem No 5
   ===========
  Enter user-name:system/Jilucse@2002
  Unreachable host
  Enter user-name:\sys as sysdba
  Enter password:sys
  Error
  Then we have to reinstall the Oracle again.

* Privilege means Permissions.
* In Oracle we can store maximum 1000 columns in a table.
* Size of the database is unknown.Making This type question is foolishness,People will laugh on us.

* MySQL does not support NVL(),NVL2() function.
* Share Lock means multiple users can lock a table.
* Exclusive lock means only user will lock a table.
